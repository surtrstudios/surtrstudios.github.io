# And There Came A Day...

*"And there came a day, a day unlike any other when Earth's mightiest heroes and 
heroines found themselves against a common threat."*

I've always thought that great things often start with a bit of happenstance and 
whimsy. I hope that this project is one of those things. It's inception began
with a day like any other. My, hope however, is that it will be remembered as a
day unlike any other - the day when *{insert studio name here}* was founded for
real. 

I've embarked on a project. It's quite simple in its aims - I will spend 52 
weeks, one year, making a video game. At the end of each week I will deliver a 
complete deliverable and a blog post detailing what went well or poorly during 
that week. The aim isn't to make money, or to deliver the next big craze in 
the industry. Instead I'm looking to learn and if I'm really very fortunate 
I'll attract other like minded people to the project.

I have some rules that I've set for myself and they're quite simple:

1. **Sprints will last one week.** They will be planned from a backlog and they
   will produce complete products. The deliverable may not be a video game, or 
   even a program but it will be complete (i.e. in the first couple of weeks the
   deliverable may not be a functioning program but design documentation). 
2. **Each member of the team will log at least 4 hours each sprint.** The goal 
   is to introduce accountability and discipline without interfering with the 
   *real world*. Anyone on the team (at the moment it's just me) will log four
   hours of work against the backlog each week. It's not a lot and probably 
   won't be enough but it's a more than reasonable number to throw out there.
3. **The game will ship.** At the end of 52 weeks the product will be published.
   Period. Whether or not it's anything anyone else will want is entirely up to 
   the team. The point is to time-box our time and gauge our ability to plan, 
   and to work. Talent will only get you so far. Dedication and commitment are 
   much more important.
